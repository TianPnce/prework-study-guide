# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
My motivation for this project was to be able to learn something that is new to me. I built this project to be able to have all of my notes for HTML,git, CSS, and JavaScript in one place, to be able to look back on as I go on. This helps me when I am stuck and forgot a command, or how to do certain things, it's good to look back on every now and then. I learned many skills such as HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.

## Usage
This Prework Study Guide contains notes about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each section carries notes and guides on how to effectively work these topics. We can also open the DevTools console, and it will allow us to see JavaScript running. That will let us see a list of topics that we learned from the prework and it chooses a topic for us to study first.
